# Abberation-Correction-using-Spatial-Light-Modulator
### Creating low-cost optical traps for teaching undergraduate Physics labs. We sought to do this by replacing the traditional expensive aberration-corrected, high-numerical-aperture lenses with cheap PDMS (silicon rubber) droplet lenses that we made in the lab. The droplet lenses are extremely cheap but prone to optical aberrations which we compensate for, externally, by using a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) along with a wavefront-correction algorithm developed by Tomas Cizmar and co-workers at the University of St Andrews. My work involved programming the SLM to run the algorithm, using python, and we were successfully able to improve the beam quality and point-spread function of the lenses. Next we worked on prototyping an 3D-printed microscopy system with precision flexure control, that also combined the SLM and droplet lenses to implement an extremely low-cost 3D optical trap

This repository contains python code to implement digital holograms to be displayed on the spatial light modulator that implemets the abberation correction algorithm
